### Magic Lunch Ball

It's easy. Sit down with your coworkers and list out your lunch places. Give them a priority:
1 means you want to go there frequently and 5 means once a year is almost too much. Make the
list interesting - include some places you aren't fond of.

Then edit data/restaurants.yml with the info and you have a random lunch generator. Deploy to
[Heroku](http://heroku.com) if you like the whole idea of free.
